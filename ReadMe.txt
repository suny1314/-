1. The file 'Smart home appliance' is the main program, which runs over the IDEAL dataset and gets the savings as the output. 

2. The outputs are stored in 'savings 2022.csv' and 'savings 2020.csv'.

3. Te file 'analysis' is the program which do the visualization jobs. The graphs are generated there.

4. The IDEAL dataset I used is from Dr Nigel Goddard and his team, the link of dataset is here: https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/3647.

5. The tariff dataset is from https://energy-stats.uk/, the one I used is southern scotland region.

5. Other than the code included in the file, I used the ideal dataset interface from the link above to access the data. I have also used the activations code, which was obtained from Dr Nigel and his team's work. That code has not been public now. Really Thank Dr Nigel Goddarad, Mr Jonathan Kilgour and Ms Elaine Farrow for their help.
